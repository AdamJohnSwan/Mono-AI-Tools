# Monorepo of AI Tools

This is a monorepo containing tools that I use with my locally running AI models.

The repo uses `uv` for dependency management and packaging.

## The tools
- knowledge-base-web-crawler
  - MCP tool that will crawl a url and then upload the result to an OpenWebUI knowledge base

## Running a project

Each project has their own README with run instructions.
